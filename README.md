# local_weather

Second intermediate front end development project from Free Code Camp. Because the world can never have enough weather websites...

### What It Does
Using the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/), we determine the user's location and current weather conditions. These are then displayed with an accompanying icon, which changes according to a) the weather, and b) whether or not it's daylight. The user can toggle between C and F.
