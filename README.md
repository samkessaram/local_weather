Because the world can never have too many weather websites!

### What It Does
Using the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/), we determine the user's location and current weather conditions, which are displayed on the page. The user can toggle between C and F. 

Both the background (generated with [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/Trianglify)) and a weather icon change according to a) the weather, and b) whether or not the sun has set.
